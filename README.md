# Organize Your Time

## Description
For this challenge I created a daily planner project that has been created to schedule appointments and events efficiently. Upon opening the planner, the current day is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar. Scrolling down presents the user with time blocks for standard business hours, each of which is color-coded to indicate its status as past, present, or future. By clicking into a time block, the user can enter an event, which can be saved by clicking the save button. The text of the saved event is stored in local storage, ensuring its persistence even upon refreshing the page.
